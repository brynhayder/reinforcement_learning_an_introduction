# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
Notes and exercise solutions to the second edition of Sutton &amp; Barto's book.

**Some of the solutions have mistakes, so be mindful! If you spot a mistake, please raise an issue and (at some point...) I'll fix it.**

Notes: 
- The code has been refactored as I've gone along, so some of the earlier exercises might break/have code duplicated elsewhere
- I used the online draft, so the numbering of sections, equations and exercises might not be consistent with the published version of the book. This is unfortunate, but I don't have time to correct it. 
- If there is a typo/mistake somewhere then let me know
